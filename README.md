# Auto Transformation

The Auto Transformation add-on assists in applying automatic transformations to objects. It identifies which objects need transformations and applies them automatically when you change a value.

## Features
- Automatically applies transformations in real time.
- Searches for and identifies objects needing transformations.
- Shows which objects require attention when the a button is pressed.
- Allows for manual application of transformations or bulk application with a single button click.
- Customizable settings to specify which types of objects need transformations.


## How to Use It

You will find the panels in the 3D viewport under the Item panel, labeled **Apply Transform** and **Search Object**.

### Apply Transform
In this panel, select which transformations to apply in real time. As you move an object, the chosen transformations will be applied based on your preferences.

### Search Object
This feature lets you find objects that need transformations. When you hit the search button, you can see which objects require attention. You can apply transformations to specific objects manually or click the apply button next to the search button, which performs both actions simultaneously. In the settings, you can specify the types of objects that need transformations.
